FUTURE UPDATES:

I. Client testimonials for each property.
II. Search bar for properties and/or available spaces, which can utilize sorting for location, price, property type, etc.
III. Add in a display toggle on the /en/leasing/properties page that allows you to turn cards on or off based on the selected cities.
IV. Add a people data point to our properties to display who the property manager and engineer are on each page.
V. Add in nearby locations to each property that would be considered attractors.
